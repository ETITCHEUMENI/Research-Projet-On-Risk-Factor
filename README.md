## Uterine rupture is an obstetric emergency with high maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality.
Our general objective was to study the risk factors of uterine rupture in two hospitals in the city of
Douala. We conducted a case-control study in the gynecology and obstetrics departments of the
Hôpital Général de Douala and the Hôpital Laquintinie de Douala. Our study population consisted
of patients who had a uterine rupture confirmed by laparotomy (Cases) and patients who had a
vaginal delivery without uterine rupture (Controls) in our study sites and during our study period
(January 01, 2011 to December 31, 2020, i.e. 10 years). Data collected from parturient records
included sociodemographic variables, clinical and obstetrical variables, management variables and
anatomical-clinical presentation variables. Statistical analyses were performed using R software
and Excel 2016 spreadsheet. After univariate and bivariate description of the variables, we
adjusted for confounding factors. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression, well matching
1 Case to 4 Controls on parity, was performed. We recruited 47 Cases and 189 Controls. No sociodemographic variables were associated with uterine rupture. Clinical and obstetric risk factors
were: gestational age <37 weeks (adjusted OR =7.41 95% CI :2.01-27.26. p=0.002), previous
caesarean section (adjusted OR= 42.10 95% CI :8.43-210.17; p=0.000), intergenital space <2 years
(adjusted OR =13.84 95% CI :3.44-40.75. p=0.000). Labor time ≥12h [ (adjusted OR =3.06 95%
CI :1.19-7.88. p<0.001, mode of admission by evacuation (adjusted OR= 124.26 95% CI :10.89-
1416.83. p<0.001), use of prostaglandins (adjusted OR =3.62 95% CI :1.30-10.05. p=0.013), new
birth weight ≥3500g (adjusted OR =7.09 95% CI :2.40-20.90. p<0.001), induction of labor
(adjusted OR =13.34 95% CI :2.51-70.84. p=0.002). The clinical signs most frequently found in
our study population were: altered general condition (87.93%), sign of shock (81.03%), palpation
of the fetus under the skin (72.41%). The main site of rupture was corporal (43.10%). Most
ruptures were complete (68.97%). Surgical treatment was mainly conservative (hysterorrhaphy
without tubal ligation) in 82.46% of Cases. Blood transfusion was used in 96.55% of Cases.
Maternal-fetal prognosis was poor, with 85% perinatal death and 17% maternal death. We
identified numerous risk factors for uterine rupture: gestational age <37 weeks, previous caesarean
section, intergenital space <2 years, duration of labour ≥12h, mode of admission by Evacuation,
use of prostaglandins, newborn birth weight ≥3500g and induction of labour. Maternal and fetal
Case fatality rates were high.
